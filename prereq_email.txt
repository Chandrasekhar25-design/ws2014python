Before attending the course, please make sure you have the following:

* A personal laptop

  If you don't have a laptop, or don't want to use one, then feel free to share
  with another person.


* A NetCDF viewer. We recommend Panoply:

  NetCDF command line tools (e.g. ncdump) can also be used.


* An installed version of Python:

  First, run the ``check_prerequisites.py`` script to see if you have all the
  necessary software. If there are any warnings, see the notes below.

  We will be using Python 2.7 in the course. Attendees are welcome to use any
  version of Python, but be aware that there are some differences between
  Python 2 and Python 3.

  If you do not have Python installed, check the following:

    packages as a single installation, and is available for free under Academic
    License. It can be downloaded here:

    Enthought also contains the packages used in this course.

  - The Python website provides installation packages:

    https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6

    Note that this does not include any individual packages, however.

  - OS X users may want to install python using MacPorts or homebrew:

    http://www.macports.org/
